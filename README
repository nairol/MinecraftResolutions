MinecraftResolutions for Minecraft 1.8.1

I use MCP 4.4 (http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases) for decompiling,
deobfuscation, recompiling, and reobfuscation. Just install it, follow it's Readme file,
put my files in the src/minecraft/net/minecraft/src folder and use the batch/sh scripts.
